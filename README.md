# Displaying-a-Word-on-LCD-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to display a word on an LCD using a PIC microcontroller. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. This project helps in understanding how to interface an LCD with a PIC microcontroller and send data for display.
