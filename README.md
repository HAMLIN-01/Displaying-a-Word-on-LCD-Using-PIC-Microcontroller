# Displaying-a-Word-on-LCD-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to display a word on an LCD using a PIC microcontroller. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. This project helps in understanding how to interface an LCD with a PIC microcontroller and send data for display.
# Overview
This project shows how to interface an LCD with a PIC microcontroller and display a word on the screen. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the circuit is simulated in Proteus.
# Features
Sends and displays a word on an LCD.
Uses 16x2 alphanumeric LCD.
Implements proper timing and control signals for LCD communication.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: PIC
Programming Language: Embedded C
IDE: MPLAB IDE
Simulation Software: Proteus
# How It Works
The PIC microcontroller initializes the LCD.
The desired word is sent to the LCD using data and control signals.
The word appears on the LCD screen.
